# Entity Relationship Diagram

This diagram shows the database schema and relationships between entities in the Vectorize system.

## Key Entities

### Core Entities

- **Dataset**: Stores information about uploaded datasets with metadata and source tracking
- **Model**: Represents AI models with tags, names, and usage counters
- **TaskStatus**: Enumeration for tracking task states (queued, running, done, failed, canceled)

### Task Entities

- **UploadTask**: Tracks dataset and model upload operations
- **TrainingTask**: Manages model training processes with dataset associations
- **EvaluationTask**: Handles model evaluation with dataset relationships
- **SynthesisTask**: Manages synthetic data generation processes

### Relationships

- **One-to-Many**: Models can have multiple training and evaluation tasks
- **Many-to-Many**: Training and evaluation tasks can use multiple datasets
- **Optional**: Datasets can optionally be generated by synthesis tasks

## Database Design Principles

1. **UUID Primary Keys**: All entities use UUID for distributed system compatibility
2. **Timestamp Tracking**: Created/updated timestamps for audit trails
3. **Task Status Management**: Consistent status tracking across all async operations
4. **Flexible Associations**: Support for complex training and evaluation scenarios
